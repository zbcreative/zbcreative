## Who We Are

ZB Creative is a web design agency founded and operated by Zack Balzer.
We specialize in building modern, fast, AI-searchable websites for small and medium-sized businesses across the United States.

Our core differentiator is that every website we build is optimized for both traditional Google search AND the new generation of AI-powered search tools — including ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude, and Microsoft Copilot. Most small business websites are invisible to AI assistants. ZB Creative fixes that.
